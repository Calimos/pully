pully
=====

A simple CLI for downloading high quality YouTube videos!

This tool allows the downloading of YouTube videos of 1080p and higher qualities. The video and audio is separate, so this combines them after dowloading both.

Further plans for this tool will be listed later, but expect a basic search functionality as well as batch download (playlists, `n` most recent, segmented videos, etc).

```
Downloads a specified video or playlist in the specified format.

Usage: pully <url> [preset]

Presets: See './data/presets'
