pully
=====

A simple CLI for downloading high quality YouTube videos!

This tool allows the downloading of YouTube videos of 1080p and higher qualities. The video and audio is separate, so this combines them after dowloading both.

Further documentation for this tool will be added later, but expect a basic search functionality as well as batch download (playlists, `n` most recent, segmented videos, etc).

## CLI Usage

```
pully <url> [preset]
```
Downloads a specified video or playlist in the specified format. See `./data/presets.json` for the presets available by default.


## Module Usage

_Coming soon!_ (Check out `./bin/pully` for an current implementation)
